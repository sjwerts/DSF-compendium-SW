# Learner Log Entry Instructions

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

# Learner Log Entry #3 - February 13, 2023

### Rose: 
I am excited to explore more about different data management tools. I was not aware there were so many different ways to organize the data, so I would like to learn more about what specific tools there are for my field and what standards I want to implement.

### Bud:
Now that I have seen some of the ways to manage data, I want to do a better job of implementing this in my own research, especially my dissertation. I am in the initial set-up for data collection, so I am excited that I can implement some of these tools immediately.

### Thorn: 
I feel like I did not get enough explanation on what data management is. I think part of it is intuitive and the discussions helped, but I think maybe seeing a clear example would be helpful or walking through how to set up a data management system from the beginning.

# Learner Log Entry #2 - February 6, 2023

### Rose: 
I really enjoyed learning more about project management, especially project governance. I think having an overview document that highlights projects roles and procedures is very important for continuity and onboarding.

### Bud:
I am curious to learn more about project management certificates and programs. I think it is such a great skill to have but most PhD programs do not teach it. I am looking into additonal ways that I can learn more about projects management or websites that can assist with project tracking. 

### Thorn: 
I am still not very clear on Cyverse and how to utilize it. I'm sure we will learn more about it, but at the outset I am confused on how to navigate it and utilize it for data storage/analysis.

# Learner Log Entry #1 - January 30, 2023

### Rose:
Something that I found particularly interesting was the concept of open data. I think there can be a lot of pros and cons about using open data, such as the potential for other scientists to scoop novel findings from the data before the original researchers. However, I think making data available in an ethical way allows for researchers who may not have the resources to collect thousands of data points to still contribute to open science. It is also a way to make federally funded research more accessible to the public.

### Bud:
I am curious about the concept of open review. I had not heard about this approach previously and I think it could be a way to make the peer-review process more transparent. However, I think it may also introduce bias. If you know someone will see your review, you may be less likely to be honest about your feedback. Additionally, it may create a target for early-career scientists who provide honest and ethical feedback against more senior researchers.

### Thorn: 
I don't think anything related to the open science lesson was challenging, but I think I need to practice more with GitHub and Markdown so I can become more proficient in the coding.

## Additional Thought:
This is a markdown sheet that I believe will help with syntax which I would like to save for later: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
