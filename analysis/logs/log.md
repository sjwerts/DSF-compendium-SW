Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.


# Learner Log Entry #1 - January 30, 2023

### Rose:
Something that I found particularly interestng was the concept of open data. I think there can be a lot of pros and cons about using open data, such as the potential for other scientists to scoop novel findings from the data before the original researchers. However, I think making data available in an ethical way allows for researchers who may not have the resources to collect thousands of data points to still contribute to open science. It is also a way to make federally funded research more accessible to the public.

### Bud:
I am curious about the concept of open review. I had not heard about this approach previously and I think it could be a way to make the peer-review process more transparent. However, I think it may also introduce bias. If you know someone will see your review, you may be less likely to be honest about your feedback. Additionally, it may create a target for early-career scientists who provide honest and ethical feedback against more senior researchers.

### Thorn: 
I don't think anything related to the open science lesson was challenging, but I think I need to practice more with GitHub and Markdown so I can become more proficient in the coding.

## Additional Thought:
This is a markdown sheet that I believe will help with syntax which I would like to save for later: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
